# Art Expo System - A Full-Stack Gallery Management Application

Welcome to the **Art Expo System**, a complete, full-stack application designed to manage and browse a sophisticated art gallery. This repository contains a multi-module project that demonstrates a modern approach to Java development, combining a powerful backend API with a responsive desktop GUI client.

This client provides a rich, user-friendly interface for browsing the gallery's exhibitions and artworks, demonstrating best practices for building robust and asynchronous desktop applications in Java.

## Project Overview

This system is architected as two separate but connected applications:

- **Backend API `(/artgallery)`:** A robust RESTful service built with **Spring Boot** and **JPA/Hibernate**. It handles all business logic, data persistence, and complex domain modeling. It acts as the single source of truth for the entire system.

- **Frontend GUI `(/artgallerygui)`:** A modern desktop client built with **JavaFX**. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend, focusing on a responsive and intuitive user experience.#


This decoupled architecture allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of the server and client components.

## Getting Started

To run the entire system, you must start the backend server first, followed by the frontend GUI client.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Git
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
- **The Art Expo System Backend must be running** on `localhost:8080`.

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Art-Expo-System

   cd ArtGalleryGUI
   ```
2. **Ensure the Backend is Running**
   Follow the instructions in the backend's README to start the server first.

3. **Run The Application**
    ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```
- The desktop application window will launch and connect to the running backend.
