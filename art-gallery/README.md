# Art Expo System ‚Äì Backend API

The **Art Expo System Backend** is a fully object-oriented, domain-driven application built using **Spring Boot**, **JPA (Hibernate)**, and **Jakarta Validation**. It provides robust functionality for managing artists, curators, artworks, and exhibitions, complete with complex relationships, business rule enforcement, and a clean **RESTful API**.
This system serves as the foundational data and logic layer for the **Art Expo** suite, offering a scalable and maintainable codebase designed to support client applications, exhibition planning, and artwork lifecycle tracking.

## Project Overview

This system models the core business operations of a modern art gallery, including:

- Management of Artists and Curators as specialized subclasses of GalleryMember.
- Scheduling and management of Exhibitions, with distinct logic for permanent and temporary types.
- Cataloging of Artworks, including their creators, genres, and display history.
- Compositional relationships between a Gallery and its physical Sections.
- State-based management of gallery sections (FREE, USED, IN_RENOVATION).
- Tracking artwork display periods using an Association Class (ArtworkInExhibition).

This backend focuses on the correct relational mapping of a complex object-oriented model to a database, implementing modern JPA strategies for inheritance, associations, and persistence.

## Features

### üé® Core Domain Features

- **Artists & Curators:** Represented as distinct subclasses inheriting from a common GalleryMember, each with unique attributes and relationships
- **Artworks:** Linked to multiple artists, categorized by a type-safe ArtGenre enum, and tracked via a unique inventory number.
- **Exhibitions:** Modeled with a deep inheritance hierarchy to handle multiple aspects (Permanent/Temporary, Themed/Individual) and polymorphic behavior.
- **Gallery & Sections:** Modeled using a strict composition relationship, where sections cannot exist without a parent gallery.
- **Association with Attributes:** The link between an Artwork and an Exhibition is managed by the ArtworkInExhibition class, which holds additional attributes like displayStartDate and displayEndDate.

### üîê Data Validation & Constraints

- **Bean Validation:** Uses **Jakarta Validation** annotations `(@NotBlank, @Size, @Min, @Max)` to enforce data integrity at the model level.
- **Logical Constraints:** Implements `@Transient` validation methods to enforce complex business rules, such as ensuring an exhibition's end date is after its start date.
- **Database Constraints:** Leverages `@Column(unique=true)` and `@Table(uniqueConstraints=...)` to enforce uniqueness at the database level.

### üîç Advanced Data Access

- **Spring Data JPA Repositories:** Provides a clean data access layer with no boilerplate code for standard **CRUD** operations.
- **Custom Queries:** Includes derived query methods `(e.g., findByStatus)` and custom `@Query` annotations for specialized lookups.
- **Optimized Fetching:** Defaults to `FetchType.LAZY` on collections to prevent the N+1 problem and ensure efficient data loading.

### üß™ Automated Testability

- Includes a default **JUnit 5** test class `(ArtGalleryApplicationTests)` that verifies the Spring application context can load successfully, establishing a foundation for further integration testing.

---

## üß± Domain Model Highlights

- **Gallery** contains multiple Sections `(Composition)`.
- **GalleryMember** is an abstract superclass with disjoint inheritance for Artist and Curator (Inheritance).
- **Exhibition** is the base of a four-level hierarchy to manage multi-aspect inheritance `(Polymorphism)`.
- **ArtworkInExhibition** models a many-to-many relationship with attributes `(Association Class)`.
- Gallery's link to Artwork is managed by inventoryNumber `(Qualified Association)`.
